# Sensitive API Keys (IMPORTANT!)
# If your GEMINI_API_KEY is hardcoded in app.py for local testing,
# you might want to remove it from app.py before committing,
# or ensure you use environment variables for production.
# If you accidentally commit it, you'll need to revoke it on Google Cloud.
# For now, if it's in app.py, it's already in your repo.
# Future: Consider adding a .env file and ignoring it.
